- Markdown file intend for simple document, at time of writing markdown file does not meet the requirment that i want but other file format will take time to note so for quick note and lesson i will use mark down and when i have time i will convert it to html
**Validation**
- The author implement validation behaviour and return `500 Internal Server Error` with this msg
